# EZPZ Fitness — continuation notes

## Canonical app
- Repository: reimerskasper-creator/Ezpz-trainer
- Branch: main
- Live: https://reimerskasper-creator.github.io/Ezpz-trainer/fitness.html
- Continue this existing app. Do not create a replacement or parallel version.

## User preferences and boundaries
- Preserve all saved browser data and existing functionality.
- The food section is approved: do not redesign it or change its recipes, grams, macros, photography, diary, meal planner or shopping behavior without a new request.
- Visual direction: green primary actions, dark green header/navigation, light backgrounds, rounded white cards, realistic workout photographs, simple mobile navigation.
- Every workout program needs a related cover photograph.
- Do not present generated workout covers as professionally verified exercise demonstrations.
- Minimum six main exercises per workout.
- The user wants meaningful named variations, organized by category, rather than only A/B labels.

## Latest implemented request
The workout chooser opens eleven photo categories. Opening a category shows five session programs with a description, equipment, estimated duration, related photograph and an expandable exercise/prescription preview.

Categories: Full Body, Push, Pull, Legs, Arms, Glute Builder, Core, Mobility, Stability, Cardio, HIIT.

55 choices total: the existing rotating Full Body plan, 16 unchanged A/B sessions, and 38 new fixed sessions. The original IDs, titles and exercise prescriptions remain stable. Existing unfinished drafts remain separate for each workout; backup restore supports the new IDs.

Examples under Full Body: Your Rotating Plan, Balanced Strength, Lower-Body Emphasis, Home Essentials, Full-Body HIIT.

Program metadata and all behavior are currently in fitness.html. See docs/workout-library-2026-10.md for program rationale and reference sources. These are original individual EZPZ sessions, not licensed professional multiweek programs.

## Storage and compatibility
Storage key: ezpz-fitness-pilot-1.
Preserve profile, logs, weights, shopping, checkedShopping, foodLog, mealPlan, mealPlanOffset, selectedWorkout, draft, workoutDrafts, workoutLayoutVersion.
The rotating Full Body uses state.draft. Fixed sessions use state.workoutDrafts[programId].
Set fields use srI-J, swI-J and sdI-J. Reps and weight fields now save on input as well as change, so editing an already completed set survives a reload even while the field remains focused.
Do not change recipe array indices. There are 49 approved photographed recipes.

## Verification
- tests/home.cjs: read-only home rendering and workout state.
- tests/recipes.cjs and tests/fixtures/approved-food.json: approved food content and base stylesheet.
- tests/app-review.cjs: logging, previous performance, progress, history, navigation and restore.
- tests/workout-photos.cjs and tests/fixtures/approved-workouts.json: all 55 choices, five per category, six main exercises minimum, distinct exercise combinations, related covers, unchanged original prescriptions.
- tests/mobile.cjs: real Chromium at 320/390/430px, all 55 program selections, category navigation, previews, drafts after reload, food, completion, history, full restore.
- Workflow: .github/workflows/mobile-checks.yml.
- A commit message containing [visual-review] makes the mobile test print a base64 JPEG contact sheet in workflow job logs. The mobile-screenshots artifact also contains full screenshots.
- Tests now compare page width with document.documentElement.clientWidth, not innerWidth, to catch mobile viewport expansion.
- The rotating Full Body week markers previously widened a 320px phone layout; they now have constrained grid tracks.
- The chooser uses a fixed heading and independently scrolling body to keep tap targets clear.

## Other recent work
Home shows selected workout, real nutrition totals, training days, weight and useful shortcuts.
Progress has genuine history, set totals and weight trend; More contains the library, settings and backup tools.
All 49 food recipes are photographed. Workout covers follow the selected program on Home and Train.
Exercise catalogue has 100 entries; technical demonstration images remain unapproved. Do not mark them reviewed without actual review.
See docs/app-review-2026-10.md for the earlier ten-app comparison.

## Future ideas, not yet authorized as a new implementation
A rest timer, post-workout summary and professionally filmed technique demonstrations were suggested. The user instead prioritized this organized workout expansion. Do not assume those suggestions were approved.

## Starting a new chat
Ask the assistant to read this file and the latest GitHub Actions results, then continue the same app. GitHub is the source of truth; fetch current main before editing.

## Last verified release
Code commit: 71a1272f93c1a3ead70f8a062df110fe5e6f2093.
Mobile workflow: https://github.com/reimerskasper-creator/Ezpz-trainer/actions/runs/39490884134 — success.
GitHub Pages workflow: https://github.com/reimerskasper-creator/Ezpz-trainer/actions/runs/39490882424 — success.
All checks passed, including real Chromium at 320/390/430px. The contact sheet was visually reviewed. No known outstanding blocker remains for this workout-library request.

## Logged-food visual polish — October 20
User authorized visual improvements to logged food only. Added a separate scoped style block (`food-log-visuals`) in fitness.html: block portion details, aligned 44px Remove controls, full-width calorie progress, readable macro tiles and less nested card padding. All existing approved functions, base stylesheet, recipes, values, images, handlers and storage remain identical. No wger/Feeel code imported; their stacks differ from this static web app. Added mobile checks and Logged-food screenshots at 320/390/430px in tests/mobile.cjs. Implementation commit 972df23; test commit fd9347e. Check their Actions results before continuing. This session has no local execution environment; verification runs in GitHub Actions.

## Day-to-four-week planning and practical sessions — October 20
User explicitly authorized replacement of Home's Plan your meals shortcut, 1-day to 4-week workout/meal planning and workout building, visible difficulty labels for every program, and practical HIIT setups. Implemented next-workout photo preview and compact weight row; My plan from Home/Train/More/Eat; 1/7/14/21/28-day ranges, day and week navigation, workout/rest selection, recipe portions, daily nutrition, copying a day or first week, and range shopping. Custom workouts can be built from scratch or cloned, scheduled, logged and restored with their drafts. Built-in beginner foundations, effort and setup are now labeled upfront.

Reworked hiit-a, hiit-b and hiit-gym to use one space (standing bodyweight; low step/counter; light dumbbells/mat). Old changed-layout drafts are archived under workoutDraftArchives, visible in More and backups; matching movements migrate by name only. History stays unchanged. See docs/planning-2026-10.md for details. All other approved recipe content and food functions are unchanged; only eat() routes to the new planning tool. Existing legacy mealPlanner() remains intact for compatibility.

New state: customWorkouts, workoutSchedule (date → workout ID or rest), plannerStart, plannerDays, plannerOffset, activePlanDate, hiitLayoutVersion=3, workoutDraftArchives. User custom sessions may have fewer than six exercises; the six-main-exercise minimum still applies to the 55 built-ins.

New tests/planning.cjs and expanded tests/mobile.cjs cover plans, custom sessions and backups. All non-browser checks passed in an in-memory harness; real asset and Chromium checks must be confirmed through the new GitHub Actions run before calling the release verified. Previous food-log run 39491993897 and deployment 39492016080 both succeeded. No local shell environment is available in this session.
